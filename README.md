The problem statement arises from the persistent challenges associated with Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging for the Arabic language. Despite advancements in natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the complex morphology and dialectal variations inherent in Arabic pose obstacles to achieving accurate and context-aware POS tagging. Compounding this challenge is the scarcity of robust Arabic word embedding techniques, hindering the development of effective models. What I aim to accomplish with this project is to strategically explore techniques for Arabic word embeddings before delving into POS tagging model development. This iterative approach aims to establish a solid foundation for understanding Arabic linguistic structures, ultimately advancing the interpretability of POS tagging in diverse contexts.
